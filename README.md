# tech-degree-3
 Third tech degree project

This tech degree has two unique features both of which are for validating the name field.

This form also has a feature where it real time validates input of each keystroke, instead of only when the submit button is keyed, this allows for better feedback and user experience. 

It will change and adjust it's error message if a user enters a number, or a special character. It will either advise "Cannot contain special character" if one is present, will advise that it cannot contain a number if one is present.
